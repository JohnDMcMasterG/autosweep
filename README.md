# AutoSweep Test Framework 

The AutoSweep project is designed to run automated testing of silicon photonic devices. It's
designed to be highly modular, giving a framework with which to organize test sequences and manage instruments, while
keeping track of device metadata, saving raw data, generating reports and handling errors.
